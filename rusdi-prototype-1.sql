Information Architecture for the World Wide Web: Designing Large-scale Web Sites</strong><br>Penulis: By Morville, Peter and Rosenfeld, Louis<br>Kategori:  Computers , Web , Design<br>Tahun: 1998<br><p><em>Deskripsi:</em> Some web sites &quot;work&quot; and some don\'t.  Good web site consultants know that you can\'t just jump in and start writing HTML, the same way you can\'t build a house by just pouring a foundation and putting up some walls.  You need to know who will be using the site, and what they\'ll be using it for.  You need some idea of what you\'d like to draw their attention to during their visit. Overall, you need a strong, cohesive vision for the site that makes it both distinctive and usable.Information Architecture for the World Wide Web is about applying the principles of architecture and library science to web site design.  Each web site is like a public building, available for tourists and regulars alike to breeze through at their leisure. The job of the architect is to set up the framework for the site to make it comfortable and inviting for people to visit, relax in, and perhaps even return to someday.Most books on web development concentrate either on the aesthetics or the mechanics of the site.  This book is about the framework that holds the two together.  With this book, you learn how to design web sites and intranets that support growth, management, and ease of use.  Special attention is given to:The process behind architecting a large, complex siteWeb site hierarchy design and organizationInformation Architecture for the World Wide Web is for webmasters, designers, and anyone else involved in building a web site.  It\'s for novice web designers who, from the start, want to avoid the traps that result in poorly designed sites.  It\'s for experienced web designers who have already created sites but realize that something &quot;is missing&quot; from their sites and want to improve them.  It\'s for programmers and administrators who are comfortable with HTML, CGI, and Java but want to understand how to organize their web pages into a cohesive site.The authors are two of the principals of Argus Associates, a web consulting firm.  At Argus, they have created information architectures for web sites and intranets of some of the largest companies in the United States, including Chrysler Corporation, Barron\'s, and Dow Chemical.</p>Relevansi: 68%<br></div><br><div class=\'book-recommendation\'><strong>2.

The Corporate Closet: The Professional Lives of Gay Men in America</strong><br>Penulis: By Woods, James D. and Lucas, Jay H.<br>Kategori:  Social Science , LGBT Studies , Gay Studies<br>Tahun: 1993<br><p><em>Deskripsi:</em> While most of us believe that professional conduct is, or should be, asexual, corporate America is in fact suffused with sexual assumptions. From its offices to its boardrooms, heterosexuality is continuously on display: alluded to in conversation and family photos, symbolized by wedding rings, and endorsed by personnel policies that award benefits to spouses and children. For the estimated ten percent of the population that is gay, including the millions of gay professionals in the corporate world, the &quot;sexual culture&quot; of these organizations forces a series of difficult choices.Now, drawing on hundreds of interviews with men all across the country and in different kinds of companies, from chief executives to recent college graduates, James Woods explores the professional lives of gay men and the various strategies they have developed for managing sexual identity at work. Whether they disguise their sexuality, reveal it, or try to avoid the subject altogether, each choice has its consequences and benefits and has profound implications for their careers, their companies, and their colleagues. This pathbreaking book explores the significance of each alternative, and in tracing the process by which gay men make the choice it illuminates the stressful realities of gay life in corporate America.In the short run, it is the men\'s self-esteem, productivity, and job satisfaction that suffer from the struggle of accommodating to heterosexual norms. But in the long run, the sexual culture of the workplace affects all professionals. Woods\' fascinating inquiry explores the dynamics of sexuality in professional life and the way it shapes our own self-definitions, values, and most deeply held ideas about work. As the workplace becomes increasingly diverse, it is time for us to look more closely at the boundaries between the sexual and the professional, and the many ways in which these worlds overlap.</p>Relevansi: 35%<br></div><br><div class=\'book-recommendation\'><strong>3.

Islam is on very thin ice with me....Through our screaming self-pity and our conspicuous silences, we Muslims are conspiring against ourselves.  We\'re in crisis and we\'re dragging the rest of the world with us.  If ever there was a moment for an Islamic reformation, it\'s now.  For the love of God, what are we doing about it?&quot;In blunt, provocative, and deeply personal terms, Irshad Manji unearths the troubling cornerstones of mainstream Islam today: tribal insularity, deep-seated anti-Semitism, and an uncritical acceptance of the Koran as the final, and therefore superior, manifesto of God. In this open letter to Muslims and non-Muslims alike, Manji asks arresting questions. &quot;Who is the real colonizer of Muslims - America or Arabia? Why are we all being held hostage by what\'s happening between the Palestinians and the Israelis?  Why are we squandering the talents of women, fully half of God\'s creation?  What\'s our excuse for reading the Koran literally when it\'s so contradictory and ambiguous?  Is that a heart attack you\'re having?  Make it fast.  Because if more of us don\'t speak out against the imperialists within Islam, these guys will walk away with the show.&quot;Manji offers a practical vision of how the United States and its allies can help Muslims undertake a reformation that empowers women, promotes respect for religious minorities, and fosters a competition of ideas. Her vision revives Islam\'s lost tradition of independent thinking. This book will inspire struggling Muslims worldwide to revisit the foundations of their faith. It will also compel non-Muslims to start posing the important questions without fear of being deemed &quot;racists.&quot;  In more ways than one, The Trouble with Islam is a clarion call for a fatwa-free future.</p>Relevansi: 36%<br></div><br><div class=\'book-recommendation\'><strong>3.

Blue Genes: A Memoir of Loss and Survival</strong><br>Penulis: By Lukas, Christopher<br>Kategori:  Psychology , Psychopathology , Depression<br>Tahun: 2008<br><p><em>Deskripsi:</em> Tony and I are brothers across the stroboscopic echoes of the past: dissolving across black interludes into the next image, and the next, and the next, until all vestige of pure vision is destroyed. All that is left is memory, and we know how faulty that can be. Who Tony was is forever blurred by who I was and how I remember who I thought Tony was . . . He is dead, and I am alive—left to dwell on questions, and to seek the answers . . .Would I, too, end up killing myself? Was the legacy of self-destruction I would discover in my family too great for me to survive? If so, when would the pendulum swing? And, if it never did, why not? How could I—almost alone among my family—escape? —From Blue GenesThis courageous, engrossing memoir explores the complex and shattering effects of a family legacy of depression and suicide on the author and his brother, the award-winning journalist, J. Anthony Lukas. Christopher (Kit) Lukas’s mother committed suicide when he was a boy. He and his brother, Tony, were not told how she died. No one spoke of the family’s history of depression and bipolar disorder. The legacy of guilt and grief haunted Kit and Tony throughout their lives.Both brothers achieved remarkable success, Tony as a gifted journalist, Kit as an accomplished television producer and director. After suffering bouts of depression, Kit was able to confront his family’s troubled past, drawing on his experience to write Silent Grief, an invaluable guide to surviving a loved one’s suicide. Tony forged a sterling career, eventually winning two Pulitzer Prizes, including one for the now-classic book Common Ground. But he never seemed to find the contentment Kit had attained; he remained creative, but depressed. In 1997, shortly before the publication of his acclaimed book, Big Trouble, Tony Lukas committed suicide.Blue Genes portrays the lives of two brothers who alternately locked horns and found solace in each other. Written with heartrending candor, it captures the devastation of this family legacy of depression, but it is also surprisingly uplifting, as it details the strength and hope that can provide a way of escaping its grasp.</p>Relevansi: 23%<br></div><br><p>Apakah Anda ingin rekomendasi buku lainnya?

From its offices to its boardrooms, heterosexuality is continuously on display: alluded to in conversation and family photos, symbolized by wedding rings, and endorsed by personnel policies that award benefits to spouses and children. For the estimated ten percent of the population that is gay, including the millions of gay professionals in the corporate world, the &quot;sexual culture&quot; of these organizations forces a series of difficult choices.Now, drawing on hundreds of interviews with men all across the country and in different kinds of companies, from chief executives to recent college graduates, James Woods explores the professional lives of gay men and the various strategies they have developed for managing sexual identity at work. Whether they disguise their sexuality, reveal it, or try to avoid the subject altogether, each choice has its consequences and benefits and has profound implications for their careers, their companies, and their colleagues. This pathbreaking book explores the significance of each alternative, and in tracing the process by which gay men make the choice it illuminates the stressful realities of gay life in corporate America.In the short run, it is the men\'s self-esteem, productivity, and job satisfaction that suffer from the struggle of accommodating to heterosexual norms. But in the long run, the sexual culture of the workplace affects all professionals. Woods\' fascinating inquiry explores the dynamics of sexuality in professional life and the way it shapes our own self-definitions, values, and most deeply held ideas about work. As the workplace becomes increasingly diverse, it is time for us to look more closely at the boundaries between the sexual and the professional, and the many ways in which these worlds overlap.</p>Relevansi: 37%<br></div><br><div class=\'book-recommendation\'><strong>3.

The Gastronomy of Marriage: A Memoir of Food and Love</strong><br>Penulis: By Maisto, Michelle<br>Kategori:  Cooking , Essays &amp; Narratives<br>Tahun: 2009<br><p><em>Deskripsi:</em> “On our first date, Rich ordered a chocolate soufflé at the beginning of the meal, noting an asterisk on the menu warning diners of the wait involved. At the time, I imagined he did it partly to impress me, which it did, though today I know well that he’s simply the type of man who knows better than to turn down a hot-from-the-oven soufflé when one is offered to him.”When Michelle Maisto meets Rich–like her, a closet writer with a fierce love of books and good food–their single-mindedness at the table draws them together, and meals become a stage for their long courtship. Finally engaged, they move in together, but sitting down to shared meals each night–while working at careers, trying to write, and falling into the routines that come to define a home–soon feels like something far different from their first dinner together.Who cooks, who shops, who does the dishes? Rich craves the light fare his mother learned to prepare as a girl in China, but Michelle leans toward the hearty dishes her father knew as a boy in Italy. Rich eats meat, but Michelle doesn’t. His metabolism races through carbohydrates, hers holds to them tightly. And while her idea of a quick meal is a fried egg, his is to head to a restaurant. After Rich takes additional work to pay for their wedding, Michelle offers to do his half of the cooking chores–which, along with the newness of their living together, challenges her feelings about the kitchen and what it means to be a modern wife.As they save and plan for a wedding, the nightly compromises, small generosities, and stubborn stakings of ground that take place around the dinner table offer a context in which Maisto considers what she’s learned from the marriages around her, and what she and Rich might create for themselves.</p>Relevansi: 30%<br></div><br><p>Apakah Anda ingin rekomendasi buku lainnya?

Yearnings: Embracing the Sacred Messiness of Life</strong><br>Penulis: By Kula, Irwin and Loewenthal, Linda<br>Kategori:  Religion , Judaism , General<br>Tahun: 2006<br><p><em>Deskripsi:</em> &quot;Irwin Kula shows us how to to live our humanness -- the pleasures and the challenges, the messiness and the triumphs -- with a profound acceptance of our desires and foibles and a joy that can only come from understanding.&quot; --Deepak Chopra &quot;Yearning. After twenty-three years as a rabbi, I can think of no more defining human experience.&quot; Life can be messy and imperfect. We\'re all looking for answers. And yet, as renowned rabbi Irwin Kula points out, the yearning for answers is no different now than it was in the times that gave rise to Moses, Buddha, and Jesus. Far from being a burden, however, these yearnings can themselves become a path to blessing, prompting questions and insights, resulting in new ways of being and believing. In this, his first book, Rabbi Kula takes us on an excursion into the depths of our desires, applying ancient Jewish tradition to seven of our most wonderful yearnings. Merging ancient wisdom with contemporary insights, Rabbi Kula shows how traditional practices can inform and enrich our own search for meaning. More importantly, he invites us to embrace the messiness and complexities of the human experience in order to fully embrace the endless and glorious project of life.</p>Relevansi: 25%<br></div><br><div class=\'book-recommendation\'><strong>2.
